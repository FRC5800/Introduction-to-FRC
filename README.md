# Introduction to FRC
# What is FRC
The First Robotics Competition (FRC) is one of the [First](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission) competitions. It is a competition made for high school students, with the aim of enhancing their skills and preparing them for the job market. [Click for more](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
# Purpose
This repository aims to be a starting guide for any FRC team, with some basic programming concepts and an "overview" of the main and essential tools used in the competition.
# Detailed Documentation
To access detailed documentation of the main FRC concepts, access our [wiki](https://github.com/FRC5800/Introduction-to-FRC/wiki) for more information. An important note is that the documentation is made especially for the Java language.
# Auxiliary Guides
